# ðŸŽ“ Course Advisor

Course Advisor is an AI assistant that helps Computer Science students discover and plan courses. It centralizes curriculum knowledge and answers planning questions so students can make confident, upâ€‘toâ€‘date decisions.

## Overview
- **What it is:** an AI helper that recommends and explains courses for Computer Science students.  
- **Why itâ€™s needed:** students face fragmented, hardâ€‘toâ€‘find information across syllabi, study plans, and registration pages; and generic AI often misses curriculumâ€‘specific, upâ€‘toâ€‘date details.  
- **How it works:** builds a structured table from the official curriculum, course descriptions, and study plan, and uses an LLM with `RAG`, `Function Calling`, and careful `Prompt Design` to retrieve the right facts and answer questions accurately.
